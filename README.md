# abc_call_volume_trend_analysis

In this project, I was experienced into the world of 
Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically focusing on the inbound calling 
team of a company. I was provided with a dataset that contains information 
about the inbound calls received by a company named ABC, which operates in 
the insurance sector. My task was to use this data to answer the following 
questions:

1. Average Call Duration:
What is the average duration of calls for each time bucket?

2. Call Volume Analysis: 
Can you create a chart or graph that shows the number of calls received 
in each time bucket?

3. Manpower Planning:
What is the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to 
reduce the abandon rate to 10%?

4. Night Shift Manpower Planning:
Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the day, 
keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.
